# Measure
## [Available to download from the Chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/measure/bbompmbliibpeaaloikpoahdokhjdmeg)

A Chrome extension measuring typographic line lengths right from the page.

The "measure" is the width of a body of type. This little tool helps you find it with a simple click in the toolbar and highlight of a line of text.

**Why would I measure line lengths?**

The length of a line of type impacts how readable it is. Generally, a good measure is between 45â€“80 characters per line.

**For designers, for developers**

Designing legible content requires a lot of attention, especially with today's range of devices. Measure can make it easy to be more precise when creating for the web.

As a designer bumbling his way through development, I'd love to receive any tips for how to write better code or tackle any of the open issues I have. Any general suggestions for how to make the product better would be great too!
