The "measure" is the width of a body of type. This little tool helps you find it with a simple click in the toolbar and highlight of a line of text.

**Why would I do that?**

The length of a line of type impacts how readable it is. Generally, a good measure is between 45â€“80 characters per line.

**For designers, for developers**

Designing legible content requires a lot of attention, especially with today's range of devices. Measure can make it easy to be more precise when creating for the web.
