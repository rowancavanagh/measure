A Chrome extension measuring typographic line lengths right from the page.

The "measure" is the width of a body of type. This little tool helps you find it with a simple click in the toolbar and highlight of a line of text.

#### For designers, for developers

Designing legible content requires a lot of attention, especially with today's range of devices. Measure can make it easy to be more precise when creating for the web.

#### Why would I measure line lengths?

The length of a line of type impacts how readable it is. Generally, a good measure is between 45–80 characters per line.

I’ve seen people copy lines of text out into a word counting website or external app, or in worst cases, clicking at the start of a line and counting frantically while holding shift and pressing the right cursor key.

As a designer bumbling his way through development, I'd love to receive any tips for how to write better code or tackle any of the open issues I have. Any general suggestions for how to make the product better would be great too!
